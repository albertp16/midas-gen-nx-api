# MIDAS Gen NX API Dashboard

A web-based structural engineering dashboard that interfaces with MIDAS Gen via its REST API for post-processing analysis results, visualizing reactions, story drift, and performing ACI beam design.

## Features

### Dashboard (index.html)
- **API Connection** - Connect to MIDAS Gen using MAPI-Key with live connection status
- **Overview** - Model statistics (nodes, elements, materials, sections), run analysis with status indicator
- **Story Drift** - Plot drift ratios for multiple load cases (X/Y direction) with allowable limit overlay, show/hide values toggle, download as image
- **Reaction Forces** - 2D plan view and 3D bar chart of foundation reactions with all force components (FX, FY, FZ, MX, MY, MZ), download images, full data table
- **Beam Results** - ACI beam design following BEAM DESIGNER format:
  - Headers: id, length, width, height, fc, fy, fys, nib/nmb/njb, nit/nmt/njt, db, shear (future), moment demand/capacity/ratio, status
  - Editable per-beam: width, height, fc, fy, nib, db (double-click to edit)
  - Rerun design with per-element overrides without re-fetching API data
  - Pass/Fail status badge, copy to clipboard, export CSV
- **Column Results** - Column force/stress/deformation tables
- **Fiber Automation** - Fiber section analysis workflow

### 3D Reaction Visualization
- Solid box rendering with proper back-face culling and face shading
- Mouse drag rotation, scroll wheel zoom, touch support
- Isometric default view (25 deg tilt, -45 deg rotation)
- Max/Min callouts with node labels

| `modes.py` | Vibration mode analysis and screenshots |
| `irregularity.py` | Building irregularity checks |

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Enter your MIDAS Gen MAPI-Key and click **Connect**
3. Navigate using the sidebar to access different result modules
4. Run Analysis from the Overview page, then fetch results from each tab

## Units

- Force: kN
- Distance: m (API), mm (beam design inputs)
- Moment: kN.m

## Requirements

- MIDAS Gen with API access enabled
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Python 3.x with `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly` (for standalone scripts)
